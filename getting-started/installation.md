# Installation

## Overview

Installing Manga+Press is pretty simple. FTP access to your server. Installation can be handled one of two ways: uploading the unzipped `mangapress` folder to your plugins directory using the FTP program of your choice, or installing through the WordPress admin`(Plugins > Add New)`. If you need more help installing WordPress plugins in general, see [Managing Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins) on the WordPress Codex.

Once the plugin is uploaded, all you need to do is activate it by visiting Plugins in the WordPress admin and selecting Manga+Press for activation.

## Updates

Updates for Manga+Press are released through the WordPress Plugin Directory, although alpha and beta versions are available from Manga+Press' [Github](http://www.github.com/jesgs/mangapress) page.
